## 📝 Tasks

### 🛠️	Build the Hangman Game

#### Description
Create a complete Hangman game that randomly selects a word and allows the player to guess letters one at a time. The game should display the current state of the word with blanks for unguessed letters, track incorrect guesses, and end when the player either guesses the word or runs out of attempts.

#### Requirements
Completed program should:

- Randomly select words from a predefined list of at least 5 words
- Accept letter guesses from the player (one letter at a time)
- Display current progress showing correctly guessed letters and blanks for remaining letters (e.g., "_ a _ _ m a _")
- Track and display the number of incorrect guesses remaining
- Prevent duplicate guesses and notify the player if they guess the same letter twice
- End the game when the word is completely guessed or all attempts are exhausted
- Display appropriate win/lose messages with the correct word revealed
